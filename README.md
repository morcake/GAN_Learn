Neural networks course assignment.

This project have three code files include Realize.py, LoadData.py, GenerateGif.py.

This design is mainly based on the generative adversarial neural network taught by the teacher and the paper reference understanding.

Thinks it and Try again, have a long time.

Through this research and experimental design, I have a deep understanding of the application principle and implementation process of GAN in restoring high-resolution images. In practice, I found that Gans have strong generative ability and flexibility, and can be widely used in various image processing tasks. At the same time, I also found that the training process of GAN is complicated and requires a lot of computing resources and time support. Therefore, one of the future improvement directions is how to improve the training efficiency and stability of GAN. In this design process, I think a good performance machine is also very important, it can help us to provide training efficiency. In addition to this design, I think we can also combine Gans with other technologies, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), etc., to make further improvements, whether it is the image quality, or the application effect of other scenes.

In the process of designing here, I mainly studied the paper deeply and understood its principles. In the process of studying, I not only cultivated my English reading ability, but also broadened my horizon of deep learning.

In the project, I have a deep understanding of the basic principle and training mechanism of generating adversarial network, and a deeper understanding of the cooperative training of generator and discriminator. In addition, by introducing VGG19 model for feature extraction, this strategy is very effective for improving the realism and detail expression of the generated image. By monitoring losses and visualizing the generated images during training, you can more intuitively understand the training of the model, which helps to quickly find problems and optimize the model. I feel that modular design contributes to the maintainability and extensibility of the code, making it easier to add and modify new features. The performance of the model is improved by optimizing the hyperparameters through many experiments during debugging.

In addition, I have more optimization ideas, such as memory management, to ensure that the memory is managed efficiently to avoid memory overflow when dealing with large amounts of image data. For example, the network structure of generator and discriminator is appropriately adjusted according to the complexity of the task to avoid overfitting or underfitting. There is also the possibility that the performance of the machine is not high, the process of running is slow, in addition to using higher performance machines, you can also consider using distributed training to speed up the model training process.
